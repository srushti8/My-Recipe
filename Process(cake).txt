How to Make Vanilla Cupcakes

step1)Preheat Oven & Prepare Dry Ingredients: To start, 
preheat your oven to 350°F and insert liners into your cupcake 
pan. In a medium-sized bowl, combine flour, baking powder & 
salt and set aside.

step2)Mix Wet Ingredients: In a large bowl, add your butter, 
sugar, oil and vanilla extract, beating together until the 
mixture is light and fluffy. This will take no less than 3-4
minutes. You’ll want to add your eggs next, one at a time, 
mixing after each until mostly combined. Scrape the sides of 
the bowl as needed to ensure all ingredients are well 
incorporated.

step3)Combine Wet & Dry Ingredients: Add half of your dry 
ingredients to the large bowl and mix until it’s mostly 
combined. Before you add the next half, slowly add the 
milk and mix until well combined. The batter might look a 
little curdled, but don’t worry! It’s supposed to look like 
that at this stage.

step4)Combine Next Half of Dry Ingredients: Add the rest of
 your dry ingredients, scraping the sides of the bowl as 
necessary. Mix until smooth and combined, but make sure 
you don’t over-mix the batter.

step5)Bake Your Cupcakes: Fill the cupcake liners 3/4 full 
and bake for 15-18 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted 
into the center comes out clean. Remove the cupcakes from 
the oven and let them cool on a cooling rack.
