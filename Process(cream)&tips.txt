Tips for the Best Vanilla Cupcakes:

:-Make sure you cream the butter, sugar, oil and vanilla 
completely. This will ensure that your cupcakes turn out 
perfect and that they’re not too dense.

:-It’s a good idea to add a bit more milk or water if your 
frosting comes out too thick. Do this a little at a time to 
avoid thinning it out too much.

:-Let your cupcakes cool completely before you frost them. 
If you don’t, the buttercream will melt and all your pretty 
piping will be ruined. You want the frosting to stay smooth 
and velvety.
